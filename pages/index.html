    <p style="background-color:green; color:white; padding:20px; text-align:center; font-size:20px; margin:0;">Saving Lives | Caring Hearts | A Better Tomorrow</p>
    <h2><b>Welcome to Wild Guardians</b></h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        Wild Guardians is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping 
        abandoned, injured, and homeless animals. Thousands of animals suffer every day 
        due to neglect, accidents, and lack of medical care. Our mission is to rescue 
        these innocent lives and give them a second chance.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        We believe that every animal deserves love, safety, and respect. Through rescue 
        operations, medical treatment, and adoption programs, we work tirelessly to 
        protect animals and spread awareness in our community.
    </p>
        <h2><b>Our Mission</b></h2>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">
            Our mission is to rescue animals in need, provide medical treatment, 
            rehabilitate them, and help them find loving forever homes. 
            We also educate people about animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.
        </p>
    <h1 style="font-size:35px;"><u>RESCUE SERVICES</u></h1>
    <h2><b>Emergency Rescue</b></h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        We respond to emergency calls involving injured, sick, or abandoned animals.
        Our trained volunteers provide immediate assistance and transport animals to clinics.
    </p>
    <h2><b>Medical Care</b></h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        After rescue, animals receive proper medical treatment, vaccinations, and surgeries 
        if required. Their health and safety is our top priority.
    </p>
    <h1 style="font-size:35px;"><u>ADOPTION CENTER</u></h1>
    <h2><b>Why Adopt?</b></h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        Adoption saves lives. By adopting an animal, you provide a loving home and 
        reduce the number of animals living on the streets.Adopting an animal is one of the most compassionate and responsible choices a person can make. Every day, thousands of animals are abandoned, injured, or left homeless due to neglect, accidents, or natural disasters. By adopting, you give these animals a second chance at life and provide them with a safe, loving, and permanent home. Adoption not only saves lives but also reduces the number of animals living on the streets or in overcrowded shelters, which often struggle to provide adequate care. It is an opportunity to make a direct and meaningful impact on an animal’s well-being while promoting awareness about animal welfare in the community. Adopting an animal also fosters a lifelong bond and teaches valuable lessons about empathy, responsibility, and commitment. Additionally, many adopted animals have already received medical care, vaccinations, and behavioral support, making it easier for families to integrate them into their homes.
    </p>
        <h2><b>Adoption Process</b></h2>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">
            Choose an animal, fill out an adoption form, attend an interview, and take 
            your new friend home.The adoption process is designed to ensure that every animal finds a safe and loving home while matching the needs of both the animal and the adopter. First, prospective adopters choose an animal they wish to adopt, either by visiting the shelter or browsing online profiles. Next, they complete an adoption form providing details about their home environment, experience with pets, and commitment to care. Some organizations may conduct an interview or home visit to ensure the adopter can provide a suitable and safe environment. Once approved, adopters can bring their new companion home, often after completing necessary vaccinations or medical check-ups. This process not only protects the animal’s well-being but also educates adopters about responsible pet ownership, helping to build a lifelong bond based on care, respect, and love.

<section>
    <h2><b>What Are Endangered Species?</b></h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        Endangered species are animals that are at high risk of extinction.
        Their population has decreased drastically due to habitat loss,
        climate change, illegal hunting, and pollution.An endangered species is a type of animal or plant that is at risk of disappearing from the Earth. Protecting endangered species is important to maintain the balance of nature and ensure that ecosystems remain healthy for future generations. Conservation efforts, such as creating wildlife reserves and raising awareness, help prevent these species from becoming extinct.

    <h2><b>Examples of Endangered Animals</b></h2>
   <h3> <b><u>BENGALI TIGER:-</b></u></h3>
 <p style="font-size:20px;"> <b>→</b> Found in South Asia, this species is endangered due.The Bengal tiger is a population of the <b>Panthera tigris</b> tigris subspecies. It ranks among the largest of wild cats. It is distributed from India, southern Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan to Southwestern China. Its historical range extended to the <b>Indus Basin</b> until the early 19th century, and it is thought to have been present in the Indian subcontinent since the Late Pleistocene about 12,000 to 16,500 years ago. It is threatened by <b> poaching, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation</b>.The Bengal tiger's coat is <b>yellow to light orange</b>, with stripes ranging from dark brown to black; the belly and the interior parts of the limbs are white, and the tail is orange with black rings. The white tiger is a <b> recessive mutant</b>, which is reported in the wild from time to time in Assam, Bengal, Bihar and especially in the former State of Rewa. However, it is not an occurrence of albinism. In fact, only one fully authenticated case of a true albino tiger is known, and there are no confirmed cases of black tigers, except for a possible specimen examined in Chittagong in 1846.Fourteen Bengal tiger skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London have 21–29 stripes.Another recessive mutant is the golden tiger that has a pale golden fur with red-brown stripes. The mutants are very rare in nature.The Bengal tiger's historical range covered the Indus River valley until the early 19th century, almost all of India, western Pakistan, southern Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and southwestern China. The modern tiger inhabits India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and southwestern China.It is estimated to have been present in the Indian subcontinent since the Late Pleistocene, for about 12,000 to 16,500 years.In 1982, a sub-fossil right middle phalanx was found in a prehistoric midden near Kuruwita in Sri Lanka, which is dated to about 16,500 years ago and tentatively considered to be of a tiger.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>→</b>Tigers appear to have arrived in <b>Sri Lanka</b> during a pluvial period, during which sea levels were depressed, evidently prior to the last glacial maximum about <b> 20,000 years </b> ago.The tiger probably arrived too late in southern India to colonise Sri Lanka, which earlier had been connected to India by a land bridge.Results of a phylogeographic study using 134 samples from tigers across the global range suggest that the historical northeastern distribution limit of the Bengal tiger is the region in the <b> Chittagong Hills and Brahmaputra River basin </b>, bordering the historical range of the Indochinese tiger.In the Indian subcontinent, Bengal tigers inhabit tropical moist evergreen forests, tropical dry forests, tropical and subtropical moist deciduous forests, mangroves, subtropical and temperate upland forests, and alluvial grasslands. The latter habitat once covered a huge swath of grassland, riverine and moist semi-deciduous forests along the major river system of the Gangetic and Brahmaputra plains, but has now been largely converted to agricultural land or severely degraded. The best examples of this habitat type are limited to a few blocks at the base of the outer foothills of the Himalayas including the Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs) Rajaji-Corbett-Pilibhit, Bardia-Banke, and the transboundary TCUs Chitwan-Parsa-Valmiki, Dudhwa-Kailali and Shuklaphanta-Kishanpur. Tiger densities in these TCUs are high, in part because of the extraordinary biomass of ungulate prey.In Pakistan, Khairpur was the last stronghold of the tiger by the late 19th century; the last individuals were shot in 1906 in Bahawalpur in the Indus Riverine jungles.</p>

  <h3> <b><u>ASIAN ELEPHANT:-</b></u></h3>
  <p style="font-size:20px;"> <b>→</b> Threatened by habitat loss and human conflict.The Asian elephant, also known as the <b>Asiatic elephant</b>, is the only living Elephants species. It is the <b>largest living land animal</b> in Asia and the second largest living elephantid in the world. It is characterised by its long trunk with a single finger-like process; large tusks in males; laterally folded large ears and wrinkled grey skin that is partly depigmented on the trunk, ears or neck. Adult males average 4.4 short tons in weight and females 3.0 short tons. It has a large and well developed neocortex of the brain, is <b>highly intelligent</b> and self-aware being able to display behaviours associated with grief, learning and greeting. Three subspecies are recognised—E. m. maximus, E. m. indicus and E. m. sumatranus.The Asian elephant is distributed in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, from India in the west to Borneo in the east, and Nepal in the north to Sumatra in the south. It frequenly inhabits grasslands, tropical evergreen forests, semi-evergreen forests, moist deciduous forests, dry deciduous forests and dry thorn forests. It is herbivorous, eating about 150 kg (330 lb) of vegetation per day. Cows and calves form groups, while males remain solitary or form "bachelor groups" with other males. During the breeding season, males temporarily join female groups to mate. Wild Asian elephants live to be about 60 years old. While female captive elephants are recorded to have lived beyond 60 years when kept in semi-natural surroundings, Asian elephants die at a much younger age in captivity; captive populations are declining due to a low birth and high death rate.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;"><b> →</b>Since 1986, the Asian elephant has been listed as <b>Endangered on the IUCN Red List</b>, as the population has declined by at least <b>50 percent</b> over the last three elephant generations, which is about 60–75 years. It is primarily threatened by <b>loss of habitat, habitat degradation, fragmentation and poaching</b>.Asian elephants are <b>crepuscular</b>.They are classified as megaherbivores and consume up to 150 kg (330 lb) of plant matter per day.Around 50 to 75% of the day is devoted to eating.They are generalist feeders, and are both <b>grazers and browsers</b>. They are known to feed on at least 112 different plant species, most commonly of the order Malvales, as well as the legume, palm, sedge and true grass families.They browse more in the dry season with bark constituting a major part of their diet in the cool part of that season.They drink at least once a day and are never far from a permanent source of fresh water.They need 80–200 litres of water a day and use even more for bathing. At times, they scrape the soil for clay or minerals.Cows and calves move about together as groups, while bulls disperse from their mothers upon reaching adolescence. Bulls are solitary or form temporary "bachelor groups".Cow-calf units generally tend to be small, typically consisting of three adults (most likely related females) and their offspring.Larger groups of as many as 15 adult females have also been recorded.Seasonal aggregations of 17 individuals including calves and young adults have been observed in Sri Lanka's Uda Walawe National Park. Until recently, Asian elephants, like African elephants, were thought to be under the leadership of older adult females, or matriarchs. It is now recognized that cows form extensive and very fluid social networks, with varying degrees of associations between individuals.Social ties generally tend to be weaker than in African bush elephants.Unlike African elephants, which rarely use their forefeet for anything other than digging or scraping soil, Asian elephants are more agile at using their feet in conjunction with the trunk for manipulating objects. They can sometimes be known for their violent behavior.</p>

 <h3> <b><u>SNOW LEOPARD:-</b></u></h3>
   <p style="font-size:20px;"> <b>→</b>The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is a species of <b>large cat</b> in the genus Panthera of the family Felidae. The species is native to the <b>mountain ranges of Central and South Asia</b>. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because the global population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and is expected to decline about 10% by 2040. It is mainly threatened by poaching and habitat destruction following infrastructural developments. It inhabits alpine and subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000–4,500 m (9,800–14,800 ft), ranging from eastern Afghanistan, the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau to southern Siberia, Mongolia and western China. In the northern part of its range, it also lives at lower elevations.Taxonomically, the snow leopard was long classified in the monotypic genus Uncia. Since phylogenetic studies revealed the relationships among Panthera species, it has since been considered a member of that genus. Two subspecies were described based on morphological differences, but genetic differences between the two have not yet been confirmed. It is therefore regarded as a <b>monotypic species</b>. The species is widely depicted in Kyrgyz culture.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;"> <b>→</b>The snow leopard's fur is <b>whitish to grey with black spots on the head</b>and neck, with larger rosettes on the back, flanks and bushy tail. Its muzzle is short, its forehead domed, and its nasal cavities are large. The fur is thick with hairs measuring 5 to 12 cm (2.0 to 4.7 in) in length, and its underbelly is whitish. They are stocky, short-legged, and slightly smaller than other cats of the genus Panthera, reaching a shoulder height of 56 cm (22 in), and ranging in head to body size from 75 to 150 cm (30 to 59 in). Its tail is 80 to 105 cm (31 to 41 in) long.Males average 45 to 55 kg , and females 35 to 40 kg .Occasionally, large males reaching 75 kg have been recorded, and small females under 25 kg.Its canine teeth are 28.6 mm long and are more slender than those of the other Panthera species.The snow leopard shows several adaptations for living in <b>cold, mountainous</b> environments. Its small rounded ears help to minimize heat loss, and its broad paws effectively distribute the body weight for walking on snow. Fur on the undersides of the paws enhances its grip on steep and unstable surfaces, and helps to minimize heat loss. Its long and flexible tail helps the cat to balance in rocky terrain. The tail is very thick due to fat storage, and is covered in a thick layer of fur, which allows the cat to use it like a blanket to protect its face when asleep.The snow leopard differs from the other Panthera species by a shorter muzzle, an elevated forehead, a vertical chin and a less developed posterior process of the lower jaw.Despite its partly ossified hyoid bone, a snow leopard cannot roar, as its 9 mm short vocal folds provide little resistance to airflow.Its nasal openings are large in relation to the length of its skull and width of its palate; thanks to their size the volume of air inhaled with each breath is optimised, and the cold dry air becomes warmer.It is not especially adapted to <b>high-altitude hypoxia</b>.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:35px;"><u>EXTINCT SPECIES</u></h1>
<section>
    <h2>What Does Extinct Mean?</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        An extinct species is one that no longer exists anywhere on Earth.
        Once extinct, a species can never be recovered.Extinction occurs when a species no longer exists anywhere on Earth. Once a species becomes extinct, it cannot be brought back. Extinction can happen due to natural causes, such as climate changes or disasters, or because of human activities like habitat destruction, hunting, and pollution. Protecting endangered species is essential to prevent extinction and maintain the balance of nature.

    <h2>Famous Extinct Animals</h2>

   <h3> <b><u>DUDO BIRD:-</b></u></h3>
 <p style="font-size:20px;">
 <b>→</b>Became extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction.The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an <b>extinct flightless bird</b> that was endemic to Mauritius, an island east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The dodo's closest relative was the also-extinct and flightless <b>Rodrigues solitaire</b>. The two formed the subtribe Raphina, a clade of extinct flightless birds that are a part of the group that includes pigeons and doves (the family Columbidae). The closest living relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon. A white dodo was once thought to have existed on the nearby island of Réunion, but it is now believed that this assumption was merely confusion based on the also-extinct Réunion ibis and paintings of white dodos. emains show the dodo measured about 62.6–75 centimetres (2.05–2.46 ft) in height and may have weighed 10.6–17.5 kg (23–39 lb) in the wild. The dodo's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings, paintings, and written accounts from the 17th century. Since these portraits vary considerably, and since only some of the illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens, the dodos' <b>exact appearance in life remains unresolved</b>, and little is known about its behaviour. It has been depicted with <b>brownish-grey plumage, yellow feet, a tuft of tail feathers</b>, a grey, naked head, and a black, yellow, and green beak. </p>
<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>→</b>It used gizzard stones to help digest its food, which is thought to have included fruits, and its main habitat is believed to have been the <b>woods in the drier coastal areas of Mauritius</b>. One account states its clutch consisted of a single egg. It is presumed that the dodo became flightless because of the ready availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of predators on Mauritius. Though the dodo has historically been portrayed as being <b>fat and clumsy</b>, it is now thought to have been well-adapted for its ecosystem.As no complete dodo specimens exist, its external appearance, such as plumage and colouration, is hard to determine.Illustrations and written accounts of encounters with the dodo between its discovery and its extinction (1598–1662) are the primary evidence for its external appearance.According to most representations, the dodo had <b>greyish or brownish</b> plumage, with lighter primary feathers and a tuft of curly light feathers high on its rear end. The head was grey and naked, the beak green, black and yellow, and the legs were stout and yellowish, with black claws.A study of the few remaining feathers on the Oxford specimen head showed that they were pennaceous rather than plumaceous (downy) and most similar to those of other pigeons.</p>

  <h3> <b><u>WOOLLY MAMMOTH:-</b></u></h3>
  <p style="font-size:20px;">
<b>→</b>The woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) is an extinct species of mammoth that lived from the Middle Pleistocene until its extinction in the <b>Holocene epoch</b>. It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with the African Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. The woolly mammoth began to diverge from the steppe mammoth about 800,000 years ago in Siberia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant. The Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) lived alongside the woolly mammoth in North America, and DNA studies show that the two hybridised with each other. Mammoth remains were long known in Asia before they became known to Europeans. The origin of these remains was long debated and often explained as the remains of legendary creatures. The mammoth was identified as an extinct elephant species by Georges Cuvier in 1796.The appearance and behaviour of the woolly mammoth are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and North America, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. It was roughly the same size as modern African elephants. Males reached shoulder heights between 2.67 and 3.49 m (8 ft 9 in and 11 ft 5 in) and weighed between 3.9 and 8.2 t (3.8 and 8.1 long tons; 4.3 and 9.0 short tons). Females reached 2.3–2.6 m (7 ft 7 in – 8 ft 6 in) in shoulder heights and weighed between 2.8–4 t (2.8–3.9 long tons; 3.1–4.4 short tons). A newborn calf weighed about 90 kg (200 lb). The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environments present during glacial periods, including the last ice age. </p>
<p style="font-size:20px;"> <b>→</b>It was <b>covered in fur</b>, with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat. The colour of the coat varied from <b>dark to light</b>. The ears and tail were short to minimise frostbite and heat loss. It had long, curved tusks and four molars, which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants, and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly <b>grasses and sedges</b>. Individuals could probably reach the age of 60. Its habitat was the mammoth steppe, which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America.The woolly mammoth coexisted with early humans, who hunted the species for food, and used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings. The population of woolly mammoths declined at the end of the <b>Late Pleistocene</b>, with the last populations on mainland Siberia persisting until around 10,000 years ago, although isolated populations survived on St. Paul Island until 5,600 years ago and on Wrangel Island until 4,000 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its ivory as a raw material, a tradition that continues today. The completion of the mammoth genome project in 2015 sparked discussion about potentially reviving the woolly mammoth through several various methods. However, none of these approaches are currently feasible.Individuals and populations showing transitional morphologies between each of the mammoth species are known, and primitive and derived species coexisted until the former disappeared. The different species and their intermediate forms have been termed "chronospecies". Many taxa intermediate between M. primigenius and other mammoths have been proposed, but their validity is uncertain; depending on author, they are either considered primitive forms of an advanced species or advanced forms of a primitive species.</p>

    <h3> <b><u>DINOSAURS:-</b></u></h3>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
 <b>→</b>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the <b>Triassic period</b>, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is a subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 mya and their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil record shows that <b>birds are feathered dinosaurs</b>, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch, and are the only dinosaur lineage known to have survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 mya. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs—birds—and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds.Dinosaurs are varied from taxonomic, morphological and ecological standpoints. Birds, at over 11,000 living species, are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates. Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 900 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains. Through most of the 20th century, before birds were recognized as dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been <b>sluggish and cold-blooded</b>. Most research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that dinosaurs were active animals with <b>elevated metabolisms</b> and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were egg-laying, and that nest-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian.While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal, many extinct groups included quadrupedal species, and some were able to shift between these stances. Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed skeletal modifications such as bony armor and spines.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>→</b> While the dinosaurs' modern-day surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied—the largest sauropod dinosaurs are estimated to have reached lengths of 39.7 meters (130 feet) and heights of 18 m (59 ft) and were the largest land animals of all time. The misconception that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy bones are more likely to last until they are <b>fossilized</b>. Many dinosaurs were quite small, some measuring about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in length.The first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, with the name "dinosaur" (meaning "terrible lizard") being coined by Sir Richard Owen in 1842 to refer to these <b>"great fossil lizards"</b>. Since then, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums worldwide, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of popular culture. The large sizes of some dinosaurs, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured their regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as the Jurassic Park franchise. Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media..Declared extinct in the <b>20th century</b>.Using one of the above definitions, dinosaurs can be generally described as <b>archosaurs</b> with hind limbs held erect beneath the body. Extinct dinosaurs, as well as modern birds, include genera that are herbivorous and others carnivorous, including seed-eaters, fish-eaters, insectivores, and omnivores. While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are all modern birds), some evolved into quadrupeds, and others, such as Anchisaurus and Iguanodon, could walk as easily on two or four legs. Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had <b>bony armor.</b></p>

    <h1><u>WAYS TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES</u></h1>
<div class="container">
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        Protecting endangered species is essential for maintaining the <b>balance of nature</b> and ensuring
        a healthy ecosystem for future generations. One of the most effective ways to protect these animals
        is by conserving their natural habitats through <b>afforestation, wildlife sanctuaries, and national parks</b>. Reducing <b>pollution</b>, minimizing plastic
        waste, and <b>controlling climate change</b> also play a major role in protecting wildlife. Other impoertant ways include:-</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enforce Laws:</strong>Governments should enforce strict laws against illegal hunting and wildlife trafficking, while people must avoid buying products made from animal skin, bones, or fur.</li>

<li><strong>Create Habitats:</strong>Create a backyard wildlife habitat. Put bird feeders and other wildlife attractants, such as bird houses and baths.</li>

<li><strong> Plant Native:</strong>Establish a pollinator garden with native vegetation in your yard. Native plants provide food and shelter for native wildlife. Attracting native insects like bees and butterflies can help pollinate your plants. Avoid planting invasive species. Non-native plants can overtake and destroy native species on which animals depend.</li>

<li><strong>Reduce Chemicals:</strong>Minimize use of herbicides and pesticides. Herbicides and pesticides are hazardous pollutants that can affect wildlife at many levels. Reduce use of fertilizer. Excess fertilizer will likely wash into streams and rivers and may lead to amphibian deformities and deaths.</li>

<li><strong> Conserve Water:</strong>Reduce your use of water in your home and garden so that animals that live in or near water can have a better chance of survival. Don’t dump paint, oil or antifreeze or other chemicals, which pollute the water and can harm people and wildlife. Keep litter and pet waste out of the street drain, which often washes into rivers, lakes or the ocean.</li>

<li><strong>Prevent Bird Collisions:</strong>Place decals on windows to deter bird collisions. Millions of birds die every year because of collisions with windows. You can help reduce the number of collisions simply by placing decals on the windows in your home and office.</li>

<li><strong>Drive Carefully:</strong>Slow down when driving. Many animals live in developed areas and this means they must navigate a landscape full of human hazards. So when you’re out and about, slow down and keep an eye out for animals. Don’t litter because trash can attract wildlife to the roadside.</li>

<li><strong>Buy Sustainably:</strong>Recycle and buy sustainable products. Buy recycled paper and sustainable products like Forest Stewardship Council wood products and shade-grown coffee to save rainforests.</li>

<li><strong>Protect Sensitive Areas:</strong>Don’t litter otherwise destroy sensitive habitats, which may be home to native isiting species that are endangered or threatened.</li>

<li><strong>Clean Up:</strong>Organize or participate in a “clean up” campaign of an important habitat in your area. (Be sure to work with appropriate city officials/environmental organizations.)</li>

<li><strong>Avoid Illegal Products:</strong>Never purchase products made from endangered species like ivory, coral and tortoise shell. Buy exotic plants and animals only from reputable stores.</li> 

<li><strong>Report Harassment:</strong>Report any harassment of threatened and endangered species.</li>

<li><strong> Visit Parks:</strong>Visit a national wildlife refuge, park or other open space. These protected lands provide habitat to many native wildlife, birds, fish and plants. Get involved by volunteering at your local park or wildlife refuge. </li>

<li><strong>Be Vocal:</strong>Write a letter to your local newspaper urging support of important species protection measures. E-mail your Congressional representatives asking them to support the Endangered Species Act. </li>

<li><strong>Join Challenges:</strong>Join others (and organize) in the annual Stop Extinction Challenge. Organized by Endangered Species Coalition.</li>
